# Waste management using Deep Learning in Tensorflow
A project based on deep learning and object detetction in Tensorflow using Faster RCNN/SSD mobilenet.

 ## Requirements
 1. Tensorflow
 2. python 3
 3. Dependencies for Tensorflow
 4. OpenCV
 
 ## Working
 3 waste boxes labelled ( recycle,organic,e waste) , upon showing any of these 3 types of wastes to the system,corresponding bin will open.
 .Raspberry pi 3 is the image recognition system and picamera for live object detection , training done in 2 days with nvidia gpu using SSD
 mobilenet.
